## React driven Step Sequencer

A step sequencer with super groovy dynamism, such as variable length loops, between one and four octaves, control over the attack and release of the synth, and so on.

You can play with it at https://alexlydiate.github.io/react-step-sequencer/

Thanks to [bit101](https://github.com/bit101) for the excellent [tones](https://github.com/bit101/tones) library, which is providing the synth.
